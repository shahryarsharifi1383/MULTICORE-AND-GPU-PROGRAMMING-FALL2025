# GPU Programming - Fall 2025
This repository hosts **teaching assistant (TA) materials for the GPU Programming course** taught by [Prof. F. Khunjush](https://fkhunjush.github.io/website/). The material includes **documentation, homeworks, examples, and other supporting resources**. It is designed specifically to support his course and help students learn parallel programming on GPUs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to provide a clean and consistent layout for both students and TAs:

- **homeworks/** — each homework folder provides instructions and starter code for students.  
- **README.md, LICENSE** — provide general project information and licensing.



## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, students should ensure they meet the following **hardware, software, and skill requirements**:

### Hardware
- A computer with a **CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU**.  
- Access to a **Linux environment** (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 recommended). Dual boot, WSL2 (with GPU passthrough), or remote lab servers are acceptable.

### Software
- **CUDA Toolkit** 
- **NVIDIA drivers** compatible with the CUDA version installed.  
- **Makefile** (for building projects).  
- **Nsight Systems / Nsight Compute** for profiling, and **Visual Studio Code** with CUDA extensions.  

### Skills
- Proficiency in **C programming** (functions, pointers, arrays, memory management).  
- Basic knowledge of **operating systems concepts** (processes, threads, synchronization).  
- Comfort using the **Linux command line** (compiling, running, and debugging programs).  
- Some background in **computer architecture** (caches, memory hierarchy, CPU vs GPU differences) is beneficial but not strictly required.  

Students who meet these prerequisites will be prepared to set up their environment quickly and focus on the GPU programming concepts introduced in this course.





## Documentation
The `docs/` folder contains additional learning materials and notes on **concepts that may not be fully covered in class lectures**. These documents are designed to give students extra support on practical topics such as environment setup, profiling tools, and CUDA programming techniques.


## Homeworks
The `homeworks/` folder contains **assignments** designed to gradually build practical skills:

1. **Profiling Homework** — Introduces performance measurement and analysis, helping students understand where programs spend time and how to identify bottlenecks.  




## Important Notes
Please read and follow these instructions carefully for **all homeworks**:

1. **Report required** — Every homework submission must include a written report.  
2. **Original work** — Reports must be written by you, not generated by AI tools or copied from others.  
3. **Evidence-based** — Reports should include clear figures, plots, tables, measurements, and proofs to support your claims.  
4. **Weight of the report** — The report carries a significant portion of the grade. Do not underestimate its importance.  
5. **Numeric proof is mandatory** — Submissions without numerical results (e.g., execution times, speedups, profiler outputs) will not be accepted.  
6. **Reproducibility** — Include enough details (code version, GPU model, parameters) so results can be replicated.  
7. **Clarity & presentation** — Write clearly, organize logically, and label all figures, plots, and tables.  
8. **Academic integrity** — Plagiarism or sharing solutions is strictly forbidden and will be penalized.
